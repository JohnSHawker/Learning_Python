1.
The program should take the user input for the number of Reavers there are and the number of units there are.
Then the program will calculate the distribution and finally print out how the units will be split between
Yondu, Quill, the crew, and the RBF.

2. 
| Input variable name | Type | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| number_of_reavers | *int* | 20 |
| number_of_units | *int* | 1000 |


| Outputs | Type | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yondu's share | *int* | 158 |
| Peter's share | *int* | 126 |
| Crew | *int* | 36 |
| RBF | *int* | 14 |

# 'input()' function
The 'input()' function will allow users to pass information into the program.
# Variables
Variables will be useful to store and pass information in the program.
# Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators will be used in conjunction with with variables and user input to calculate the correct values for our outputs.
# 'print()' function
The 'print()' function will be useful to print out the calculated output for unit distribution to the user.

number_of_reavers = input("How many Reavers: ")
number_of_units = input("How many units: ")
crew_leave_cost = (number_of_reavers - 2) * 3
number_of_units = number_of_units - crew_leave_cost
yondu_13_percent = number_of_units // (1 / 0.13)
number_of_units = number_of_units - yondu_13_percent
peter_11_percent = number_of_units // (1 / 0.11)
number_of_units = number_of_units - peter_11_percent
crew_pay = number_of_units // number_of_reavers
rbf = number_of_units - (number_of_reavers * crew_pay)
yondu_total = yondu_13_percent + crew_pay
peter_total = peter_11_percent + crew_pay
print("Yondu's share:", yondu_total)
print("Peter's share:", peter_total)
print("Crew: ", crew_pay)
print("RBF: ", rbf)

1. If the unit input to my program is 1000 and the number of Reavers input is 20, then Yondu's portion should be 158 units.
2. If the unit input to my program is 1000 and the number of Reavers input is 20, then Peter's portion  should be 126 units.
3. If the unit input to my program is 1000 and the number of Reavers input is 20, then each crew member should get 36 units.
